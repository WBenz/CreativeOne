It is                now estimated that over seven thousand people were killed by the                explosive fires that raged through Raccoon in the early hours of                Sunday, October 4. It is being called the worst U.S. disaster in                terms of lives lost since the industrial age, and as national aid                organizations and international press flock to the blockades                surrounding the still burning ruins of the city, shocked friends                and family of Raccoon citizens have been gathering, waiting for                word in nearby Latham.                National Disaster Control (NDC) Director Terrence Chavez,                coordinator for the combined efforts of the multiple firefighting                and emergency teams, released a statement to the press last night                stating that barring unforeseen complications, he expects the last                of the flames to be extinguished before midweek, but that it may                be months before the origin of the fire is determined, as well as                whether or not arson was involved. Said Chavez, \"The magnitude                of the damage in terms of area alone is going to make finding the                answers a great undertaking, but the answers are there. We will                get to the bottom of this, whatever it takes.\"                As of 6 A.M. today, seventy-eight survivors have been found,                and their names and conditions withheld; they have been                transported to an undisclosed federal facility for observation                and/or treatment. Initial reports by HazMat teams suggest that an                unknown illness may be responsible for the incredible number of                victims, as infected citizens were unable to escape due to the                possibly incapacitating sickness. There is the further suggestion                that the disease may have induced violent psychosis in some of                those infected. Members of private and federal disease-control                centers have called for extending the quarantine boundaries, and                although no official statement has been released, there have been                several \"leaked\" descriptions of physical and biological abnormali-                ties in many of the victims. Said one source, a worker for a federal                assessment team, \"Some of those people weren't just burned or                dead from smoke inhalation. I saw people who'd been killed by                gunshot wounds or stabbings, and other forms of violence. I saw                people who'd obviously been sick, dead, or dying long before the                fire ever hit. The fire was bad - terrible - but it's not the only                disaster that occurred there, I'd bet money on it.\"                Raccoon City was in the news earlier this year when a series of                unusual murders rocked the community. These were apparently                unmotivated slayings, of extreme violence, and several involved","cannibalism; already, tentative connections are being made by                local press near Raccoon between the eleven unsolved murders                from last summer and the rumors of mass violence prior to the                consuming flames.                Mr. Chavez refused to confirm or deny the rumors, saying only                that investigations into the tragedy will be thorough. . .                Nationwide Today, A.M.. Edition, October 10,1998                RACCOON DEATH TOLL RISES                AS SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS COMBINE EFFORTS                NEW YORK, NY - The official body count now stands at just under                4500, with the blackened ruins of Raccoon City still being combed                for additional victims of the apocalypse that took place early last                Sunday morning. As a nation's mourning begins, over six                hundred men and women are working to uncover the reasons                behind the destruction of the once peaceful community. Local                relief organizations, scientists, soldiers, federal agents, and corpo-                rate research teams have come together in a show of determina-                tion and purpose, pooling resources and accepting delegated                responsibilities in order to get to the truth.                NDC Director Terrence Chavez, the official head of the effort,                has been joined by top researchers from disease-control centers all                around the world, national security agents from several federal                branches, and a privately funded team of microbiologists from                Umbrella, Inc., the pharmaceutical company, which is investigat-                ing the possibility that there may be a connection between their                chemical lab on the outskirts of the city and the strange infection                now being called \"Raccoon syndrome.\"                Initial studies of this illness have been vague and inconclusive,                says Umbrella team leader Dr. Ellis Benjamin, \"but we're                convinced that the citizens of Raccoon were infected with                something, either accidentally or intentionally. All we know at this                point is that it doesn't seem to have been airborne, and that the                final result was rapid cellular disintegration and death; we still                don't know if it was bacterial or viral, or what the symptoms were,                but we won't rest until we've exhausted all of our resources.                Whatever the findings, and whether or not Umbrella materials                were a part of it, we're committed to seeing this through to the                end. It's the least we can do, considering how much our company                owes the people of Raccoon.\" The Umbrella chemical plant and                administration facilities in Raccoon City provided nearly a thou-                sand local jobs.                The 142 survivors are still being held in quarantine for                observation and questioning at an undisclosed location. While                their identities are still being protected, the FBI has released a                statement listing medical conditions. Seventeen survivors suffered                minor injuries but are in stable condition, seventy-nine are still on                a critical list following surgical procedures, and forty-six of the                survivors, while not injured, have suffered some major mental or                emotional breakdown. There is no confirmation as to whether or                not any are infected with the syndrome, but the statement did                include a reference to survivor's stories that verified the existence","of the infection.                Gen. Martin Goldmann, overseer of military operations in the                ravaged city, is hopeful that all of those still missing will be found                within the next seven days. \"We've already got four hundred                people out there working twenty-four/seven, searching for survi-                vors and running identification checks - and I just got word that                another two hundred will be coming in on Monday...\"                Fort Worth Bugler, October 18, 1998                POSSIBLE CONSPIRACY                BY CITY EMPLOYEES IN RACCOON TRAGEDY                FORT WORTH, TX - New evidence uncovered by cleanup crews in                Raccoon City, PA, indicates that the \"Raccoon syndrome,\" the                disease responsible for the majority of the 7200 deaths that have                occurred in Raccoon as of this writing, may have been unleashed                upon the unsuspecting populace by Raccoon Police Chief Brian                Irons and several members of the Special Tactics and Rescue                Squad (S.T.A.R.S.).                At a press conference held early yesterday evening by FBI                spokesman Patrick Weeks, NDC Director Terrence Chavez, and Dr.                Robert Heiner - called in by Umbrella team leader Dr. Ellis                Benjamin - Weeks revealed that there is strong circumstantial                evidence that the disaster in Raccoon was the result of a terrorist                act that went horribly wrong. The subsequent fires that have                nearly wiped out the small city may have been an attempt by Irons                or one of his accomplices to cover up the disastrous effects of the                spill.                According to Weeks, several documents were found in the                wreckage of the RPD building that implicate Irons as the                ringleader of a conspiracy to take hostage the Umbrella chemical                plant on the outskirts of the city. Allegedly, Irons was furious with                city officials over the suspension of the S.T.A.R.S. in late July for                their mishandling of a multiple murder investigation - the now                well-documented cannibal slayings that took the lives of eleven                people early last summer. The Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. were suspended                after a helicopter crash in the last week of July that claimed the                lives of six team members. The five surviving S.T.A.R.S. members                were suspended without pay after evidence suggested drug or                alcohol abuse in connection to the crash - and while Irons                publicly advocated the suspension of his elite squad, the docu-                ments found indicate that Irons meant to threaten Mayor Devlin                Harris and several City Council members with a spill of extremely                volatile and dangerous chemicals unless certain financial demands                were met. Weeks went on to say that Irons had a history of                emotional instability, and that the documents - correspondence                between Irons and an accomplice - revealed a plan by Irons to                extort ransom from Raccoon and then flee the country. The                accomplice is named only as \"C.R.,\" but there are also references                to \"J.V.,\" \"B.B.,\" and \"R.C.\" - all initials for four of the five                suspended S.T.A.R.S.                Said Terrence Chavez, \"Assuming these documents are accu-                rate, Irons and his crew had planned to storm the Umbrella plant","at the end of September, which would correspond exactly to the                timeline described by Dr. Heiner for the Raccoon syndrome to                achieve full amplification. We're currently operating under the                assumption that the takeover did take place, and that an                unexpected accident occurred with cataclysmic results. At this                time, we don't know if Mr. Irons or any of the S.T.A.R.S. are still                alive, but they are wanted for questioning. We've released a                national APB and all of our international airports and border                patrols have been alerted. We urge anyone with information                relating to this case to come forward.\"                Dr. Helner, a renowned microbiologist as well as an associate                member of Umbrella's Biohazardous Materials Division, stated that                the exact mix of chemicals released in Raccoon may never be                known. \"It's obvious that Irons and his people didn't know what                they were handling - and with Umbrella continuously developing                new variations of enzyme syntheses, bacterial growth mediums,                and viral repressers, the lethal compound was almost certainly an                accidental aggregation. With the possible combinations of materials                numbering in the millions, the odds of duplicating the Raccoon                syndrome mix are astronomical.\"                The S.T.A.R.S. national director wasn't available for comment,                but Lida Willis, regional spokesperson for the organization, has                gone on record as saying that they \"are shocked and saddened\" by                the disaster, and would devote every available agent to the search                for the missing S.T.A.R.S. team members, as well as for any                contacts they might still have within the network.                Ironically, the documents were found by one of Umbrella's                search teams...                 ONE                \"GO, GO, GO!\" DAVID SHOUTED, AND JOHN                Andrews hit the gas, whipping the minivan around a                tight corner as gunfire thundered through the cold                Maine night.                John had spotted the two unmarked black sedans                only a moment before, which had barely given the                team enough time to arm themselves. Whoever was                on their ass - Umbrella or the S.T.A.R.S. or the local                cops - it didn't matter, it was all Umbrella.                \"Get us lost, John!\" David called, somehow manag-                ing to sound cool and controlled even as bullets                riddled the back of the van. It was the accent - he                always sounds like that, and where the hell's Fal-                worth?                John felt scattered, his thoughts racing and jum-                bled; he kicked ass on a mission, but sneak attacks bit                the bone -                - right on Falworth and head for the strip - Christ,                ten more minutes and we would've been gone -                It had been too long since John had been in combat,","and never in the midst of a car chase. He was good,                but it was a minivan.                Bam bam bam!                Someone in the back of the van was returning fire,                shooting out of the open back window. The nine-                millimeter explosions in the tight space were as loud                as the voice of an irate God, pounding at John's ears                and making it even harder to focus.                Ten more goddamn minutes.                Ten minutes from the airstrip, where the chartered                flight would be waiting. It was like a bad joke - weeks                of hiding, waiting, not taking any risks, and then                getting tagged on the way out of the damn country.                John hung on to the wheel as they shot down 6th                Street, the van too heavy to outmaneuver the sedans.                Even without five people and a shitload of artillery,                the bulky, boxy knockoff mini wasn't exactly a power-                house. David had bought it because it was so nonde-                script, so unlikely to be noticed, and they were paying                for it - if they managed to shake their pursuers, it'd                be a small miracle. Their only chance was to try to                find traffic, play some dodge. It was dangerous, but so                was getting run off the road and shot to death.                \"Clip!\" Leon shouted, and John shot a look in the                rearview, saw that the young cop was crouched at the                back window next to David. They'd taken out the back                seats for the trip to the airstrip, all the more room for                weapons, but that also meant no seatbelts; take a                corner too fast and bodies would be flying...                Bam! Bam! Two more blasts from the sedan ass-                holes, maybe from a .38. John gave the shuddering                van a little more pedal as Leon returned fire with a                Browning nine-millimeter. Leon Kennedy was their                best shot, David probably had him trying to draw                bead on the tires -                - best shot next to me, anyway, and how the hell am                I going to get us lost in Exeter, Maine, at eleven o'clock                on a weeknight? There is no traffic -                One of the women tossed Leon a mag, John didn't                have time to see which one as he jerked the wheel                right, heading for downtown. With a smoking squeal                of rubber on asphalt, the mini teetered around the                corner of Falworth, heading east. The airstrip was                west, but John didn't figure that anyone in the van                was worrying much about getting to the plane on                time.                First things first, gotta ditch Umbrella's hired goons.                Doubt there's room on the charter for all of us.                John saw red and blue light in the mirror, saw that                at least one of the sedans had put a flasher on the roof.                Maybe they were cops, which would really suck.","Umbrella's job of spin control had been thorough -                - thanks to them, every cop in the country probably                believed that their small team was at least partly                responsible for what had happened to Raccoon. The                S.T.A.R.S. were being played, too - some of the                higher-ups had sold out, but the agents in the trenches                probably had no idea that their organization had                become a puppet of the pharmaceutical company -                - which makes it a hell of a lot harder to shoot back.                No one on their makeshift team wanted innocents                to get hurt; being misled by Umbrella wasn't a crime,                and if the sedan teams were cops...                \"No antennae, no warning, not cops!\" Leon called,                and John had time to feel about a second's worth of                relief before he saw the barricades looming in front of                them, the roadwork sign propped next to the blocked                street. He saw the white circle of a man's face above                an orange vest, the man holding a sign that said                \"Slow,\" the man dropping the sign and diving for                cover...                ... and it would've been funny except they were                doing eighty and had maybe three seconds before they                hit.                \"Hang on!\" John screamed, and Claire pushed her                legs against the van wall, saw David grab hold of                Rebecca, Leon snatching at the handle -                - and the van was screeching, jerking, and bucking                like a wild horse, spinning sideways...                ... and Claire actually felt open space beneath the                right side of the van as her body was compressed to                the left, the back of her neck crunching painfully                against the tire well.                - oh hell -                David shouted something but Claire didn't hear it                over the squealing brakes, didn't understand until                David dove to the right, Rebecca scrambling right                next to him -and wham,                the van dropped back to the ground                with a terrific bounce and John seemed to have it                under control again, but there was still the piercing                screech of locked brakes coming from...                CRASH!                The explosion of metal and shattering glass behind                them was so close that Claire's heart skipped a beat.                She turned, looked out the back with the others and                saw that one of the cars had barreled into a roadwork                barricade - a barricade they'd probably come within                a second or two of bashing into themselves. She                caught just a glimpse of a crumpled hood, of broken                windows and a stream of oily smoke, and then the                second sedan was blocking her view, shrieking around","the corner and continuing the chase.                \"Sorry 'bout that,\" John called back to them,                sounding anything but; he seemed wired with                adrenaline-pumped glee.                In the few weeks since she and Leon had joined up                with the fugitive ex-S.T.A.R.S., she'd discovered that                John would make jokes about anything. It was simul-                taneously his most endearing and most annoying                trait.                \"Everyone alright?\" David asked, and Claire nod-                ded, saw Rebecca do the same.                \"Took a whack but I'm okay,\" Leon said, rubbing                his arm with a pained expression. \"But I don't                think...\"                BAM!                Whatever Leon didn't think was cut off by the                powerful blast that slammed into the back of the van.                Still most of a block away, the sedan's passenger had                fired a shotgun at them; a few inches higher and the                pellets would have come in through the window.                \"John, change of plans,\" David called as the van                swerved, his cool, authoritative voice rising over the                noise of the screaming engines. \"We're in their                sights...\"                Before he could finish, John took a hard left.                Rebecca fell backwards, nearly crashing into Claire.                The van was now headed down a quiet suburban                street.                \"Hold on to your butts,\" John called over his                shoulder.                Chill night air whipped through the van, dark                houses flying by as John picked up speed. Leon and                David were already reloading, crouched behind the                metal half-door. Claire exchanged a look with                Rebecca, who looked as unhappy about their situa-                tion as she felt. Rebecca Chambers was ex-S.T.A.R.S.,                she'd worked with Claire's brother, Chris, as well as                undertaking a recent Umbrella operation with David                and John, also ex-S.T.A.R.S. - but the young woman                had been trained as a medic with a background in                biochemistry. Marksmanship wasn't her forte - even                Claire was a better shot - and she was the only person                in the van who hadn't had any real training . . .                . . . unless you count surviving Raccoon.                Claire shuddered involuntarily as John took a hard                right, veering wide around a parked truck, the sedan                gaining ground. Raccoon City; the scratches and                bruises on Claire's body hadn't even faded yet, and                she knew that Leon's shoulder was still giving him                pain...                BAM!","Another shotgun blast from behind, but it went                wide and high.                This time. . .                \"Change of plans,\" David said, his crisp British                accent calming, like the voice of reason and logic in                the midst of chaos. It was no wonder he'd been a                S.T.A.R.S. captain.                \"Everyone brace for an impact. John, just past your                next turn, bring us to a stop. Hit and run, alright?\"                David brought his knees up, wedging his feet                against the van's wall. \"They want us so badly, let                them have us.\"                Claire slid over and pushed her feet against the                back of the passenger seat, knees bent and head down.                Rebecca moved closer to David, and Leon sidled back                so that his head was close to Claire's. They locked                gazes and Leon smiled faintly.                \"This is nothing\" he said, and in spite of her fear,                Claire found herself smiling back at him. After mak-                ing it through the madness of Raccoon City, skirting                the murderous Umbrella creatures and crazed hu-                mans - not to mention their extremely narrow escape                from explosive death when Umbrella's secret facilities                blew up - compared to all that, a simple car wreck                was like a Sunday picnic.                Yeah, just keep telling yourself that, her mind whis-                pered, and then she didn't think anything at all,                because the van was swerving around a corner and                John was pumping the brakes and they were about to                get hit by about a ton and a half of fast moving metal                and glass.                David inhaled and exhaled deeply, relaxing his                muscles as best he could, the squeal of brakes coming                up fast from behind...                ... and wham, violent motion, a sense of incredible                vibration, a second that seemed to stretch for an                endless and silent eternity...                ... and the noise coming immediately after - break-                ing glass and the sound of a tin can being crushed                amplified a million times. David was jerked forward                and back, heard Rebecca emit a strangled gasp -                - and it was over, and John was already hitting the                gas as David rolled to his knees, raising his Beretta.                He shot a look out the back and saw that the sedan                was motionless, skewed across the dark street, the                front grill and headlamps smashed all to hell. The                slumped, shadowy figures behind the spidered glass                were as still as the ruined car.                Not that we fared much better. . .                The inexpensive green minivan he'd bought specifi-                cally for their ride to the airfield no longer had a","bumper, tail lights, a rear license plate - or, he imag-                ined, any possible method for opening the back gate;                the door was a warped and crunched-up mass of                useless metal.                No great loss. David Trapp despised minivans, and                it wasn't as though they'd planned on taking it to                Europe. The important thing was that they were still                alive - and that - for the moment at least - they'd                managed to avoid the infinitely long arm of Umbrel-                la's wrath.                As they sped away from the wrecked car, David                turned and regarded the others, reflexively putting a                hand out to help Rebecca up. Since the ill-fated                mission to the Umbrella lab on the coast, he'd grown                quite attached to the young woman, as had John. The                rest of his team hadn't survived...                He shook off the thought before it could take hold,                and called up to John that they should circle back                toward their original destination, staying away from                major streets. A bad break that they'd been spotted                just as they were leaving, but not all that surprising,                however. Umbrella had staked Exeter out two months                earlier, right after they'd returned from Caliban Cove.                It had only been a matter of time.                \"Nice trick, David,\" Leon said. \"I'll have to re-                member that next time I get chased by Umbrella                goons.\"                David nodded uncomfortably. He liked Leon and                Claire, but wasn't so sure how he felt about two more                people looking to him for leadership. He could under-                stand it with John and Rebecca, they'd at least been                part of the S.T.A.R.S. before - but Leon was a rookie                cop from Raccoon and Claire was a college student                who just happened to be Chris Redfield's little sister.                When he'd made the decision to break from the                S.T.A.R.S. after finding out about their connection to                Umbrella, he hadn't expected to continue leading,                hadn't wanted to -                - but it wasn't my decision to make, was it... he                hadn't asked for their allegiance, or offered himself up                as decision maker and it didn't matter, that was just                the way things had turned out. In war, one didn't                always have the luxury of choice.                David glanced around at the others before staring                out the back, watching the homes and buildings slip                past in the cold dark. Everyone seemed a bit subdued,                always the aftermath of an adrenaline rush. Rebecca                was unloading clips and repacking the weapons, Leon                and Claire sitting close together across from her, not                talking. Those two were usually joined at the hip, and                were still as tight as they'd been since David, John,"];
